# ASL Alphabet Gesture Recognition with Flask

I have went through git hub repositories for a model with better accuracy and use that pre trained model for the prediction of the signs. I will also paste the code for the model for your reference.

Users can upload an image of a hand gesture, and the application will predict the corresponding letter or symbol.

The model can be found in pre trained ASL model folder. As the model size is too large, i have shared the drive link in the MODEL DRIVE LINK FILE.md file.

This model predicts the American Sign Language gesture. The dataset link can be found in the Data folder.

I have also shared a test images folder through which u can test the model.

Just run the app.py code in your terminal. Then follow the link given in the terminal.

U will redirected to this [link](http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict).

Now choose a file from the test images. Next click on the upload button. It shows the predted alphabet.
